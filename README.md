# MiniCastleFront

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.1.0.

## Tree structure guide

For a better understanding and navigation of the project, here is how it is arranged:

- In the App folder, you'll find 6 folders:
        -> Body -> our app.component.html, containing our router, navbar logic and loaded pages.
        -> Core -> Contains all our classes 
        -> Feature -> Contains our actual pages
        -> Layout -> Contains our single-use components 
        -> Services -> Contains our services, our calls, which communicate with our backend 
        -> Shared -> Contains components that are reused throughout the application (mainly cards).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
