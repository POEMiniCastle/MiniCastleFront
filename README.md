## Tree structure guide

For a better understanding and navigation in the project, here is how it is arranged:

In the App folder, you'll find 6 folders:

1. Body -> our app.component.html, containing our router, navbar logic and loaded pages.
2. Core -> Contains all our classes.
3. Feature -> Contains our actual pages.
4. Layout -> Contains our single-use components.
5. Services -> Contains our services, our calls, which communicate with our backend. 
6. Shared -> Contains components that are reused throughout the application (mainly cards).

## Install the server
Install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/fr).

Run `npm install` to install the dependencies. 

Run `ng serve` to run the application.

Navigate to http://localhost:4200. 

You now have access to the web application.
